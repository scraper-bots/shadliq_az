## 💡 Conclusion

The Baku wedding venue market is **highly competitive, price-sensitive, and digitally engaged**. Success requires more than competitive pricing—it demands strong online presence, professional photography, and strategic positioning. The weak correlation between price and popularity (r=0.022) is the most significant finding, indicating that value proposition, marketing, and reputation drive customer engagement more than price alone.

Geographic clustering in areas like "8 km" creates competitive hotspots, while underserved areas present expansion opportunities. The prevalence of budget venues (≤40 AZN) reflects a price-conscious customer base, yet premium venues successfully capture niche segments. For stakeholders, the path forward involves differentiation through quality, marketing excellence, and customer experience rather than price competition alone.
